### Introduction:
Stock price prediction is an important topic and traditional prediction methods are usually based on statistical and econometric models. However, these models are difficult to deal with time series data, so for this problem machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction and in this project, we will predict SABIC closing price using time series analysis with ARIMA and using a forecasting model: The Prophet.

### Objectives:
- Determine SABIC performance over the years.
- Calculating the volume for SABIC and Nomu over the years.
- Determine the correlation between TASI and Nomu.
- Predict SABIC closing price using time series analysis with ARIMA.
- Predict SABIC closing price using a forecasting model: The Prophet.
